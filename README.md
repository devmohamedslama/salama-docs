**Salama Docs** is a comprehensive knowledge base covering professional development, technical research, and innovation projects. This documentation serves as a centralized repository for strategies, research findings, and experimental work.

## Overview

The documentation is organized into four main categories:

**Strategy & Growth** — Business strategies, ASO optimization plans, and marketing frameworks for sustainable growth and market positioning.

**Technical Research** — In-depth analysis of emerging technologies, system architecture patterns, artificial intelligence concepts, and mobile development methodologies.

**Innovation Lab** — Experimental projects, proof-of-concepts, creative ideas, and learning initiatives that push the boundaries of conventional approaches.

**Resources** — Setup guides, contributing guidelines, and configuration documentation to help users navigate and extend the knowledge base.

## Contents

1. **[ASO Strategy](docs/strategy/ASLY_ASO_PLAN.md)** — App Store Optimization methodologies and implementation frameworks
2. **[AI Concepts](docs/research/ai-concepts.md)** — Fundamental artificial intelligence principles and applications
3. **[System Design](docs/research/system-design.md)** — Architecture patterns and scalability considerations
4. **[Mobile Architecture](docs/research/mobile-architecture.md)** — Platform-specific development approaches and best practices
5. **[Ideas & Concepts](docs/personal/ideas.md)** — Innovative project concepts and creative solutions
6. **[Experiments](docs/personal/experiments.md)** — Active research projects and proof-of-concepts
